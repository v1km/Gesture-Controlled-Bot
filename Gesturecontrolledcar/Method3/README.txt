Components:
arduino x 2
RF transmitter and receiver module 433 mhz
l293d driver ic
dc motor X 2
9v batteries  X 2


Scenario:
the transmitter side of arduino is connected to accelerometer to take the reading which manipulates and accordingly transmits through
the 433mhz transmitter mod.
the receiver side of arduino is connected to receiver module which takes the data and accordingly apply the signals to l293d.

Note:
the arduino ,accelerometer,transmitter to be mounted to hand and receiver side either on chassis or toy car.
